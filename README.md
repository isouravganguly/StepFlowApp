# StepFlowApp - Enhanced User Data Collection Flow

## The Challenge: Engaging Users During Data Collection

Modern applications often require phases dedicated to collecting user information, whether for onboarding, personalization, or specific features (like skin/hair type analysis). Standard forms or flows can sometimes feel tedious, leading to drop-off or disengagement. There's a need for a more focused, intuitive, and visually appealing way to guide users through these crucial steps.

## The Solution: Introducing `StepFlow`

`StepFlowApp` demonstrates a dedicated component, **`StepFlow`**, designed specifically to address this challenge. It provides a self-contained, configurable flow for presenting questions and capturing user selections, prioritizing an improved User Experience (UX).

**Core Idea:** Create a distinct, immersive experience for multi-step data collection, making it feel less like a chore and more like an interactive process.

## Key Features & Design Philosophy (POC)

*   **Focused UX:** Employs a clean interface with **bold, readable typography** and clear visual cues (like selection states) to minimize cognitive load and enhance clarity. (Visuals below showcase this).
*   **Smooth Transitions:** (Future Goal/Implied) Designed with smooth screen transitions in mind to make the progression feel fluid. *(Note: Actual animations might be added later)*.
*   **Configurable Steps:** The flow is driven by a simple JSON-like configuration (`Step[]`), making it easy to define different sequences of questions (single-choice, multi-choice) fetched dynamically (e.g., from Firebase).
*   **Self-Contained Logic:** Encapsulates the state management (current step, selections) and navigation logic *within* the `StepFlow` component itself.
*   **Minimal Dependencies (Intentional Choice for POC):**
    *   **No Global State Management:** Avoids libraries like Redux or Zustand to keep the core `StepFlow` logic isolated and easy to understand in this initial version.
    *   **No External Navigation Library:** Manages its internal screen progression without relying on React Navigation or similar libraries, demonstrating its capability as a standalone flow component. This simplifies integration into various parts of a larger application.
*   **Service Integration:** Demonstrates fetching configurations and saving results via a dedicated service (`stepFlowService`), decoupling the UI from data operations.

## Visual Showcase

*(This is where you'd embed screenshots or, even better, a GIF demonstrating the flow)*

**Example:**

*   [Screenshot of a Question Screen - showing bold text, clear options]
*   [GIF demonstrating selecting an option and moving to the next step]
*   [Screenshot of the Results Screen]

*(**Tip:** Use tools like LiceCap or Kap to create simple GIFs of your simulator/device)*

## Getting Started (Running the Demo)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
    ```bash
    cd StepFlowApp
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Install Pods (for iOS):**
    ```bash
    cd ios && pod install && cd ..
    ```
4.  **Configure Firebase:**
    *   Follow the [React Native Firebase setup guide](https://rnfirebase.io/) to add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and `google-services.json` (Android).
    *   Ensure you have Firestore enabled and have sample test configurations (e.g., documents named `HAIR` and `SKIN` in a `tests` collection) structured according to `src/features/StepFlow/types.ts` (`{ config: Step[] }`).
5.  **Run the app:**
    *   **iOS:**
        ```bash
        npm run ios
        # or
        yarn ios
        ```
    *   **Android:**
        ```bash
        npm run android
        # or
        yarn android
        ```

## Next Steps & Future Considerations

*   Implement robust input validation based on `Step.validation` rules.
*   Add subtle animations for screen transitions and option selections.
*   Integrate actual user authentication to replace placeholder logic.
*   Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests.
*   Explore integration with global state management and navigation if/when the `StepFlow` needs to interact more deeply with a larger application context.
